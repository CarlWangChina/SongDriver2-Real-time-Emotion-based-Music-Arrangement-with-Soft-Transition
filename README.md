# SongDriver2-Real-time-Emotion-based-Music-Arrangement-with-Soft-Transition
We propose SongDriver2. Specifically, we first recognize the last timestep's music emotion and then fuse it with the current timestep's target input emotion. The fused emotion then serves as the guidance for SongDriver2 to generate the upcoming music based on the input melody data.
