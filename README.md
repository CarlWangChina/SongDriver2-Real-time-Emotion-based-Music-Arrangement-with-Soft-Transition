# SongDriver2: Real-time Emotion-based Music Arrangement with Soft Transition
We propose SongDriver2. Specifically, we first recognize the last timestep's music emotion and then fuse it with the current timestep's target input emotion. The fused emotion then serves as the guidance for SongDriver2 to generate the upcoming music based on the input melody data. 


# The respository structure
* **APP_Code**: the code of application including fontend and backend. The users can interate with the application by selecting their current emotion and the generated music by SongDriver2 or the recommneded music will be played.

* **SongDriver2_Code**: the code of SongDriver2 pipeline, which is implemented by Pytorch.

* **SongDriver2_Music_DEMO**: the demo music generated by SongDriver2.
